                    <p>
                        I'm a Web Developer by day, dream builder by night. <br>
                        Coding and Designing has become an important part of my life for some time now. As a career switcher, it feels like I've found home. <br>
                        Being able to give shape and form to an idea for the whole world to see feels like a superpower to me. I want to use this knowledge of mine to help people, build websites and apps that can help in every imaginable way possible. <br><br>
                        Aside from all that though, on my free time I usually play the guitar, I write songs, I sing.
                        I like board games, video games, movies and sitcoms. <br>
                        But yeah, watching the sea or nature in general is what truly makes me calm. <br>
                        I'd love to have a caravan somewhere pretty.
                        Maybe one day, right? <br>
                        I also have a pet bunny, Geppetto. <br>
                        She says hi as well.
