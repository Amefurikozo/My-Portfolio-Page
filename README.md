### MY PORTFOLIO PAGE

This website was created during my first months of learning the basics of web design and web developing, it's my second effort at building a portfolio-like website, so it feels kind of special to me.  
I kind of tried to do a few things differently from the regular, design wise that is.. and I'm quite fond of the results.  

It's made with HTML, CSS and a lil bit of Javascript.   
It's been SEO & Performance optimized... and all viewport sizes considered, responsiveness seems like 95% finished too.  

I'll be updating this from time to time, as some fine tuning and other general operations need to be done still.

But all in all, feel free to pay a visit and take a look around.  
You can even send me a message by completing the corresponding form with your thoughts, or basically anything you'd like.  

Thanks, have a nice day.
