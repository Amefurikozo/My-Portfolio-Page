                                I think I'm in a pretty good spot so far, but the will to become the very best I can is still overflowing. Motivation is sky high and the clouds in my mind are dispersed. I love designing and I enjoy coding. I want to keep on improving my skills and knowledge and live a decent life thanks to my efforts and passion. I want to create beautiful pages and apps, implement ideas with a heartfelt purpose, as well as help people come closer to their own dreams and goals.

                            <p>The general idea is to be able to make a living through a job that I love and have passion for. In the end, I hope to be able to do things like: travel more, do cool stuff, buy a better guitar, get a caravan, adopt a dog, maybe have kids and show them that not everything is gloom and doom. Play board games and video games with them. Basically I want to live proud and go out with a smile. Doesn't sound bad does it?</p>

                                <p>
                                    I'm an ambitious developer, I want things to work and look as perfect as possible, giving lots of time even for the smaller details, because i care.
                                    <br><br>
                                    For that reason alone, i tend to offer a fixed price per project. 
                                    In order to avoid stressful situations for the both of us, as well as keep things fair. This way, you avoid having to overpay because of me working overtime to accomplish the best results possible.
                                    <br>
                                    So basically, I offer a flat rate price that will be suggested upon filling up the <b style="text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;">Proposal Plan</b> form.
                                    <br><br>
                                    I'm currently a freelancer at my first steps, rest assured though I'll put the best of my efforts to meet your expectations. I want to be successful and bring food to my table as well.
                                    <br>
                                    So feel free to reach out to me about anything, I'll do my best to ease any of your worries.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Starting with a kick-off meeting, then homepage design, any iterations, designs of remaining pages and sign-off on final designs. 
                                    
                                    You'll be handed out templates of websites to choose from, so we can pre-define the layout of things.
                                    Detailed information regarding design options will be provided. From layout, to colors, to typography, to interactivity.
                                    Everything we decide on and do should fit the canvas correctly.

                                    I can provide any additional services outside of the scope for a small additional price. These can be any additional designs, changes to the website, additional training, brainstorming sessions, etc.

                                    Even though there are free options out there, there's a chance you might wish
                                    to have assets that require expenses. Assets such as paid fonts, stock photos,
                                    third-party tools, etc. 
                                    It would help result in a more personalized website, due to less accessible assets.
                                    If there's a wish for such, it will be discussed before making any purchases.
                                    This portfolio page uses none of those, still looks pretty though, right?

                                    If the client cancels the project after it has started, the client will pay for the 
                                    time the freelancer has worked on the project. Even if the client does not intend 
                                    to use the produced work.
