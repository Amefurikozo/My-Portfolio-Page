						<h2>Hey, my name is Charis.</h2>
						<hr />
						<p>
							I'm a Web Developer by day, dream builder by night. <br />
							Coding and Designing has become an important part of my life for
							some time now. As a career switcher, it feels like I've found
							home. <br />
							Being able to give shape and form to an idea for the whole world
							to see feels like a superpower to me. I want to use this knowledge
							of mine to help people, build websites and apps that can help in
							every imaginable way possible. Learning more and creating projects
							with utmost care is what I do.
							<br /><br />
							Aside from all that though, on my free time I usually play the
							guitar, I write songs, I sing. I like board games, video games,
							movies and sitcoms. <br />
							But yeah, watching the sea or nature in general is what truly
							makes me calm. <br />
							I'd love to have a caravan somewhere pretty. Maybe one day, right?
							<br />
							I also have a pet bunny, Geppetto. <br />
							She says hi as well.
